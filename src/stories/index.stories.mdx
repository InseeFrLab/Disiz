<Meta title="Quick start" />

```bash
yarn add disiz @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled tss-react powerhooks

# If you plan on using icons from: https://mui.com/components/material-icons/
yarn add @mui/icons-material
```

At this stage, the documentation is under the form of a very simple [demo project](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/disiz/tree/main/src/test).  
The actual theme configuration [happens here](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/disiz/blob/main/src/test/src/theme.ts).  
If you want to experiment with it you can run the demo app with:

NOTE for [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) users: As of writing this lines storybook still uses by default emotion 10.  
mui and TSS runs emotion 11 so there is [some changes](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/disiz/blob/9f58cfffb3483f26d5b0218189ad8cc2f7f89df9/.storybook/main.js#L31-L32

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InseeFrLab/disiz
cd disiz
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```
